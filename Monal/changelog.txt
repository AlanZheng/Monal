Monal is a multi protocol IM client that supports XMPP (Jabber) and AIM.   It will connect to any XMPP  chat server e.g. Google talk, facebook chat. It is a direct client and does not transmit your password to a 3rd party.  Monal has been tested heavily with google talk, facebook, openfire  and ejabberd servers.  Monal will work with corporate XMPP servers that require VPN.
